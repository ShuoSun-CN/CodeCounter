# **A CodeCounter Based On Sliding Window**
## Primary algorithm
We create the program which help you count your code based on sliding Window. We use the sliding window to identify the head of function whose format is **A(B){...}**. It means that you can use it to count  function number and lines of your code, such as C, CPP and JAVA.

## How to use
For the  plugin of GUI, we use the base Python package named tkinter, so you needn't  install it.
You just need run the command:
```bash
python GUI.py
```
